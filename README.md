**What is Greenstand?**

> Greenstand is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization developing open-source technology to address climate change and alleviate poverty through digitizing environmental goods and services. We are made up of about 350 contributors across the globe. Our Treetracker app verifies and tracks individual trees, thus creating transparency in the reforestation sphere. Organizations and donors can locate individual trees and trade their ecological impact. By facilitating ownership of trees and their ecological services, Greenstand allows for tree-growing organizations to stay accountable.

### Personal Projects

- Flashcard App

A react app I made to use to study flashcards. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm to sort the cards in a way that promotes the most memory.

- Chess App

Another react app I made to play chess. It uses sockets to have real-time chess with timers. It also has a backend for authentication, database, etc. You can also play puzzles on there since I used the Lichess Puzzle Database, which is CC.

- Math Revision App
